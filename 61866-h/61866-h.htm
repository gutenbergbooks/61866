  <h3>ANNUAL MEETING.</h3>

<p>We are happy to inform our friends that very satisfactory
arrangements have been perfected for our Annual Meeting.
Railroad facilities and steamboat accommodations have been
granted at reduced rates and an able corps of speakers will be
present and participate in the meeting. As this number of the
<span class="smcap">Missionary</span> will reach our readers at an earlier date than
usual, we give full particulars on the 4th page cover.</p>

<h3 title="TWELVE MONTHS">&nbsp;</h3>

<p><i>Twelve Months.</i>—Receipts from collections and donations,
$186,200.56, from legacies, $126,366.73, making a total of
$312,567.29, an increase of $14,982.84 over the total for last
year. This encouraging showing is to be credited to legacies which
have been unusually large. Our payments for the year, less balance
in hand at the beginning of the year, have been $312,018.97,
leaving a balance in hand for the new year of $548.32. For this
result we rejoice and give thanks to God. We have not been able
to accomplish all that has been pressing upon us from our several
mission fields, but our faith is strong and we ask for still larger
gifts and more extended efforts in the fields now white for the
harvest.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
</div>


<div class="article">
<h3>THE HOUR.</h3>

<p>The hour is at hand for the annual review of the work and wants
of this Association. The rapid progress of events amid which its
influence is a constant factor, necessitates vigilant study, wise
deliberation, and prompt action. There are divine favors to seek,
interests to hold, opportunities to embrace, and hindrances to
overcome.</p>

<p>Possibly nothing is more to be feared among the latter than apathy.
The belief that a work is well in hand, successful, hopeful,
helpful, often gives a sense of rest that fosters unconcern,
or little concern, for its entrenchment and enlargement. This
condition weakens the intensity of prayer and relaxes effort. More
than this, apathy among the friends<a class="pagenum" name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a> of a work like ours is liable
to give way for misconception or lack of comprehension of its place
in the religious destinies of mankind.</p>

<p>We have a mission for the promotion of righteousness. Our success
is not to be measured by the rule, or the balance, but by what it
accomplishes in the establishment of right principles. It must be
judged of by the tone it gives, and not by the zone it occupies.
The business of this Association is not for one clime, but for
all climes. It aims to suppress ignorance, oppression, misrule,
poverty, sin and shame, and to plant and nourish those ennobling
truths which yield peace, plenty and life everlasting. Our very
fundamental principles debar us from doing anything less broad and
catholic than that directed alike against caste, oppression and all
injustice. We must be left free to apply our benefits where the
evils we seek to destroy have their strongholds. We are bound to
recognize moral conditions, but not color. Color is not guilt or
essential misfortune.</p>

<p>Another hindrance to fear is the attention likely to be drawn to
the political aspects of our work. These have their place and
rightful claims. Good government is helpful to good learning
and the interests of religion, but the object of a missionary
society is primarily to promote pure Christianity. While it enters
amid all shades of political opinions, it must contend with the
unrighteousness of all alike. It must not be allured or guided by
the possibilities of national events. Its kingdom is not of this
world.</p>

<p>Akin to political aspects are denominational interests. These have
their allurements also, which, if indulged excessively, only tend
to part the garment of Christ. Forms and ceremonies well may serve
the interest of missions, but woe be the day when missions are
wrested to serve the interest of a form or polity.</p>

<p>Still another danger lies in the allurements of expedients. The
constant fluctuations in human affairs serve to unsettle the
faith and to relax the hold on the steady, enduring methods which
alone can give success. It is never to be forgotten that while
the surface may have the appearance of a refluent stream when
contending with the elements, yet God’s cause is imbedded in the
deep under-current and moves right on despite appearances. Great
essentials, great faith, wisdom from above, and persistent action
alone can overcome these hindrances, and advance our work as it
should be advanced.</p>

<p>What is demanded most by the hour is a revival of missionary zeal.
Let there be a fuller sense of our responsibility to Christ, and a
greater realization of our duty to those without. Let there be more
constant exercise of the power of prayer. Let the spirit come upon
us that counts all things secondary to the grand triumph of the
Redeemer’s kingdom. Let us be willing to lose all, to spend all,
and to suffer all to hasten that, and God will not withhold His
blessing, neither shall His coming be delayed.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></p>

Warner, for whom it was named. The building, of brick, upon a
fine crest in that hill country, was formerly a ladies’ college
for white people. Friend Warner having conducted the institute
for several years, proposed to transfer it to this Association.
This has been done, and the school is yet to carry along the good
work begun by the founder. His many friends in this country and in
England, who have aided him in the enterprise, may rest assured
that the institute will be kept true to its original mission. Mrs.
J.&nbsp;B. Nelson, who had formerly been employed by Mr. Warner, has
been made principal, with the needed assistants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> programme for a series of twenty-eight missionary
meetings, which our agent for New Hampshire and Vermont had planned
to be held in those States in August and September, under the
auspices of this Association was carried out, in due time, with
great completeness and success, the last of the course being held
Sept. 28, afternoon and evening, in Manchester, N.H. The number of
sessions, counting those held in different places on the Sabbath,
was fifty-one. In almost every case the attendance, especially
at the second or evening session, was large and enthusiastic.
The addresses were varied, able and interesting. The brief but
touching story of Philip Page, who often told in broken English, in
a pleasing way, how and why he came to this country, what he had
found here, what he is doing, and how he hopes to go back some day
and tell his parents and others in Africa what Christ the Lord can
do for them, and the address of Rev. Joseph E. Smith, graduate of
Atlanta University, now pastor of the First Congregational Church
in Chattanooga, were always listened to with much interest. The
latter told of his bitter slave life, of his trials and struggles
and triumphs, in coming over from bondage into freedom, from the
slave pen and the auction block to the school, the college, the
pulpit and pastorate; addresses were also made by Prof. Thos. N.
Chase of Atlanta, Dr. Woodworth, of Boston, and by Rev. Mr. Grout,
who conducted the meetings.</p>

<p>The ready and hospitable welcome with which the speakers and
attendants<a class="pagenum" name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a> from abroad were uniformly received by the churches
visited, the hearty and efficient co-operation of the several
pastors and other church officers, and the kindly notices of the
meetings given the public, from time to time, by the press of the
States and of the localities in which the conventions were held,
are reported as very cheering and indicative of a deep interest in
our great work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> give in this number a cut of the church and parsonage
at Anniston, Ala., Rev. H.&nbsp;W. Conley, pastor. This is the town of
the Woodstock Iron Company, located ten years ago upon the bare red
fields. Now it has two iron furnaces, a cotton factory, an immense
machine shop, two railroads, a newspaper and a wonderful thrift. At
the beginning the company gave the church lot, aided on the church
and built the parsonage, helping also in the support of the pastor
and teacher. The church and school have been a blessing to the
families of the colored operatives of the place. This mission is a
beautiful illustration of the work this Association is doing for
the colored people South.</p>

<h3>GENERAL NOTES.</h3>


<h4>AFRICA.</h4>

<p>—The Niger Mission reports 4,000 souls as under regular Christian
instruction.</p>

<p>—Three of Arabi Pasha’s children are in the United Presbyterian
Mission school at Cairo, Egypt.</p>

<p>—Mr. Stanley has discovered a lake on one of the tributaries of
the Congo which he has named Lake Leopold Second.</p>

<p>—The London Missionary Society has two mission ships that sail
between its stations in New Guinea, two in Africa, and one in the
South Seas.</p>

<p>—An English Methodist missionary laboring in Africa reports that
on going to the coast recently he was saluted by a trader with the
remark: “There must have been a lot of heathen joining your church
lately.” “Yes, it is so,” he was answered; “but how did you come to
know it?” “Oh, because there have been a lot of heathen people here
buying dresses, shawls, etc.”</p>

<p>—A new expedition, under German auspices, is being fitted out for
the exploration of the Upper Niger and the regions adjacent. It
starts out under competent leadership and promises good results in
knowledge of a portion of Africa as yet little known, but supposed
to be of large commercial importance.</p>

<p>—At the request of the Egyptian Mission, the last General Assembly
directed the Board of Publication to contribute $2,000 to aid in
the work of publishing a new edition of the Bible in Arabic in
large type. In compliance with this the Board of Publication on
the 5th of this month paid over the $2,000 to the American Bible
Society, who have the work now under way.</p>

<p>—According to a proposed treaty between Portugal and the Sultan
of Zanzibar, the two governments will engage that none of their
subjects buy or sell slaves in their respective territories. Any
one convicted of having violated the treaty will be delivered up
to the government, punished in consequence and his slaves set at
liberty.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE CHINESE.</h4>

<p>—The Hawaiian law prohibiting Chinamen from coming to the Islands
has been repealed, and 3,000 Chinese laborers have recently
contracted for their passage there.</p>

<p>—There is a Chinaman at work in Tahiti, in the South Sea Islands,
who is said to be a whole Bible Society in himself, expending
twenty dollars a month, out of a salary of twenty-five dollars, for
Bibles to distribute among his countrymen there.</p>

<p>—M. Thiersant
estimates the Mohammedan population of China to be between twenty
and twenty-one millions, and says he has arrived at his figures
from facts given by Mandarins, Romish priests, and other prominent
individuals. Mr. Blunt, in “The Future of Islam,” allots fifteen
million Moslems to China.</p>

<p>—According to Missionary Butler, of China, as Buddhism has no
heaven for women, the Chinese damsels labor with might and main to
lay up merits that they may prevail with the judges of the lower
world to let them be born again as men, so that they may have a
chance to get there.</p>

<p>—A Chinese Christian tailor thus described the relative merits of
Confucianism, Buddhism, and Christianity:—</p>

<p>“A man had fallen into a deep, dark pit, and lay in its miry
bottom, groaning and utterly unable to move. Confucius walked by,
approached the edge of the pit, and said, ‘Poor fellow, I am sorry
for you; why were you such a fool as to get in there? Let me give
you a piece of advice: If you ever get out, don’t get in again.’ ‘I
can’t get out,’ groaned the man. <em>That is Confucianism.</em></p>

<p>“A Buddhist priest next came by, and said, ‘Poor fellow, I am very
much pained to see you there. I think if you could scramble up
two-thirds of the way, or even half, I could reach you and lift
you up the rest.’ But the man in the pit was entirely helpless and
unable to rise. <em>That is Buddhism.</em></p>

<p>“Next the Saviour came by, and, hearing his cries, went to the
very brink of the pit, stretched down and laid hold of the poor
man, brought him up, and said, ‘Go, sin no more.’ <em>That is
Christianity.</em>”—<cite>Rev. Canon Stowell.</cite></p>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE INDIANS.</h4>

<p>—There are 296 church buildings among the Indians, including the
“five nations.”</p>

<p>—The religious bodies expended in 1881 the sum of $139,440 for
education and missions among the Indians.</p>

<p>—Out of the 260,000 Indians, there are 100,000 who have discarded
blankets and are wearing citizens’ dress, wholly or in part.</p>

<p>—The Ute Indians, who have steadily refused to send any of their
children to school, now have twenty-five in the training-school at
Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>

<p>—The Indian reservations include 155,632,312 acres, of which
18,000,000 are tillable. Already the American Indians are
cultivating more than half a million acres of this land.</p>

<p>—The Indian Mission School at Fort Wrangle, Alaska, in which
Mrs. McFarland is teaching, has increased in numbers and interest
the past year, and many of the pupils have become Christians. One
of the oldest girls has been married to a Christian Indian, and
gone as a missionary to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a> Upper Chilcat, where they both are doing
faithful service. Several more of the girls are prepared to engage
in mission work in their tribes as soon as the way opens.</p>

<p>—The Albuquerque <cite>Morning Journal</cite> says: “The best thinkers
all now agree that education is the true solution of the Indian
problem. We have tried fighting them and feeding them, and both
these plans have signally failed, but education, in the few
experiments we have tried with it, has been thoroughly successful,
and if we can establish and maintain schools enough to educate the
children that are now growing up, our Indian difficulties will be
at an end, and the coming generation of Indians, instead of being
savages, to be hunted down by troops, or ‘corraled’ like wild
beasts and fed at the public expense, will be peaceful and useful
citizens.”</p>

<h3>VACATIONING.</h3>

<p class="secauth">PROF. A.&nbsp;K. SPENCE, FISK UNIVERSITY.</p>

<p>“What did your students do during vacation?” Various things. But
with few exceptions they did not rest. Quite a number are young
and went to their homes in town and country—the girls to help
their mothers, the boys their fathers. Some hired out for house
and farm labor. One farms on his own account. One was head waiter
in a summer hotel in Tennessee. Two worked on a farm in Minnesota
and two, sons of a professor, on one in Ohio. Some ran on sleeping
cars in the North, and made up the beds you lay on. One worked in
the railroad exposition in Chicago. One kept store and studied law
in West Tennessee. One preached in Florence, Ala., with the usual
blessing of God on his labors. One was employed by the State of
Texas in holding institutes. Former students of ours were also
employed in the same way. But, as usual, the most of those advanced
enough to do so taught school. Not to mention those of low grade,
out of seventy-eight enrolled in the collegiate department last
year, fifty-seven taught school. The colored man seems by taste
and circumstances to be a school teacher. Occasionally a student
teaches who ought to rest. It is the thing to do. It is rather a
shame not to. The long-instructed desires to instruct. The young
fledgling wants to try its wings, the Demosthenes his oratory,
the Hercules his club. Long before vacation begins we teach
thinning classes, and lament many an empty seat the first Monday
in September. This is hard on scholarship, but necessary for the
purse, and good for their own manhood and the people whom they
teach.</p>

<p>Schools must be taught when they are held, and held when the
children can be spared from the farms. This varies with latitude
and the products raised. In the cotton region it is when the crop
is “laid by,” that is after the last hoeing and before the first
picking, and begins in April or May. In the wheat and grass regions
schools commence in June, July or even August. Those whom we lose
by early schools in the spring we get promptly in the fall, and the
reverse.</p>

<p>The most of the teachers who have returned report nothing
remarkable, no doubt the best kind of a report to have to make.
Honest, legitimate labor has<a class="pagenum" name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a> never much to say for itself. Among
the things mentioned in addition to the paid labor of the work are
these: securing libraries, papers, Testaments for Sunday-school,
teaching infant class, teaching Bible class, leading singing,
superintending; and one did all this, organizing his entire school
into one class. He also rented an organ which he played. One or
more held prayer meetings. All had religious exercises in school.
A few gave temperance lectures. One had a temperance glee club.
Several gave musical entertainments, especially at close of school,
white and colored in attendance. One county in this State is
almost exclusively occupied by students from Fisk. They organized
themselves into an institute, meeting once a month for the
discussion of methods and the interests of education in general.
By invitation Prof. Bennett attended the last meeting, delivering
addresses and preaching on the following Sunday. He found the
colored people gathered <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i> and the interest up to fever
heat.</p>

<p>About the usual number of misfortunes has befallen our students
this year. One is shortsighted and wears spectacles; he is also
quite light colored. Both these damaged him. He was taken for a
Jew trying to pass himself off as a colored man. White and colored
alike looked upon him with suspicion. He succeeded in persuading
the colored people that he was one of them, but the whites had no
use for the “white nigger in spectacles.” By continued insult and
threats his nervous system was so worn upon that he fell sick and
left after teaching a month. Two young men teaching in a river
county in Mississippi had, briefly told, the following experience:
The boat could not land at the place sought, but they were put
ashore at midnight, three miles away. There were two houses at the
landing, one being unoccupied. In this they got permission to spend
the night. They lay on bags of cotton-seed. There being no means of
fastening doors, one of them put his money, two dollars and fifty
cents, in his shoe, under his foot, for safe-keeping. The next day
they walked through mud and rain to the town, and from there set
out in search of schools.</p>

<p>To secure a school is frequently a thing of no small difficulty.
The young men or women must make a journey of miles through
blind ways on foot or with such conveyance as can be found. The
neighborhood being reached, the leading colored people must
be approached as the first step. The community is Baptist or
Methodist, and the school will be held in the church. “What are
you?” “I am a Congregationalist.” “What is that?” If denominational
difficulties are overcome, the next thing to do is to meet the
white trustees. They may be in favor of <em>home talent</em>. These
foreign students carry money out of the country. They look
independent and may teach things not in the book. But here is
Sam. He can read. He owes ’Squire So-and-so. If he gets the
school he will pay him. We favor Sam. If, however, Sam cannot by
every contrivance pass the examination, the Fisk student appears
before the County Superintendent. But here a new difficulty. The
Superintendent holds an institute to prepare persons to pass his
own examination, charging them five dollars apiece. Those who
attend are quite sure to pass. It is wise for the Fisk student to
be at that institute, pay his fee and pass, for when that institute
is over the time for getting a school in that county is up. This
state of things does not exist in all places, let us hope not in
many, but it does in some. It is quite a common rule never to
give a first-class certificate, no matter what the scholarship,
to a colored student, as in most States it increases his pay, and
perhaps it would not seem fit for a colored boy or girl to get a
better certificate than some white young man or woman. There are
exceptions to this rule. In one examination in which there were
forty candidates, two got first-class certificates. These two were
from Fisk.</p>

<div class="article">
<h3>A WANT—READING ROOMS.</h3>

<p class="secauth">PROF. ALBERT SALISBURY.</p>

<p>It is hard to realize, even when we make the conscious effort,
how much of the general culture, intelligence, and power of the
American people is due to the habit of reading. That there is
not a more marked and easily discernible difference between the
intelligence and practical efficiency of the college-bred man and
of the man of less training is largely due to the fact that the
one reads as widely and continually as the other. Even superficial
and omnivorous reading is an efficient source of intelligence and
power. So universal is this habit of reading among the native-born
people of the Northern States, that it is hard for them to conceive
of its absence. It costs us an effort to imagine the mental status
of a person who cannot or does not read. Yet there are millions
of people in the South who cannot read and millions more who do
not. It is one thing to teach a child how to read; it is quite
another thing to make him <em>love</em> to read, to give him the <em>habit</em>
of reading. And the first has comparatively little value without
the other. It is of little moment that a million children have been
taught the art of reading if they do not practice it freely.</p>

<p>Now the fact is that of the hundreds of thousands who have been
in the freedmen’s schools but a very small part have ever formed
the reading habit. And, as one consequence, even college graduates
of the colored race have far less general intelligence and
intellectual efficiency than white people of much more limited
education.</p>

<p>There is nothing singular or unaccountable about this. It is the
natural consequence of the circumstances existing. The parents of
these young people were slaves, to whom reading was a forbidden
art. In their houses, highly as the ability to read may be prized,
and earnestly as it may be sought for their children, there are as
yet no books, no magazines, no newspapers even. If, indeed, there
be any printed thing there, it is almost without exception of the
most trashy, crude, and worthless, if not vile and corrupting,
sort, from both the literary and the moral point of view. The dime
novel, the “Fireside Companion,” the sloshy, ungrammatical local
newspaper are, at the best, all that one may hope to find. In
cultured homes, children acquire the habit of reading by contagion.
It is fairly <em>bred</em> into them. But in the homes of the freedmen
there is no contagious example, and there can be none. There is for
the colored youth no inheritance of culture in any way. Children
in Northern homes take in more of culture through the skin, by
unconscious absorption, in the first ten years of life than the
freedmen’s children can ever acquire except by long years of
schooling.</p>

<p>From the consideration of these facts, two conclusions
follow—first, that for the intellectual uplifting of the colored
race it is absolutely essential that the reading habit be
established in some way; and, second, that it should be the active
endeavor of all the missionary schools to devise and employ the
best agencies for stimulating and establishing this habit.</p>

<p>Now comes the practical question, What are the instrumentalities
by which we can implant and cultivate the love of profitable and
elevating reading?</p>

<p>Of course, something may be done in the regular course of
instruction. Reading in school may be so taught as to give real
culture of taste and appreciation. The sips of good literature
found in the reading-books may be so used as to create a desire to
drink freely at the fountain-head; though it is to be confessed
that many teachers fail lamentably in this direction. The student
of history or geography may and should be pushed out of his
text-book into the wide field from which text-books<a class="pagenum" name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a> are gleaned.
Yet all this has much of the flavor of the daily task about it.
Can anything be done to make the act of reading more spontaneous,
to make it seem more like an indulgence and a recreation than an
exaction and a duty?</p>

<p>The answer need not be a negative. It is to be found in
reading-rooms, wisely placed and planned. And much stress is to be
laid on these qualifications.</p>

<p>The first requisite for a reading-room is accessibility. It must be
placed where it can be got at easily and continually. A locked-up
library, open only once or twice a week at a stated hour, with the
issue of books held under formal regulations is utterly futile as
a means of creating the reading habit; it is useful only for those
who have the habit already formed. A reading-room must not only be
conveniently placed where the pupils can not escape it, as it were,
but it must also be open at all times; so that in all the moments
of leisure, whether in the hours set apart for labor or those for
recreation, there may be the freest access, that even “he that
runs” may read a little. It, therefore, becomes almost a necessity
in a boarding-school that there be two reading-rooms, one for each
sex.</p>

<p>The second requirement for success is that the reading matter
be well chosen, selected with regard to the ends in view. It is
absurd to suppose that reading matter so stale, dull or obstruse
as to have no longer any value among a reading people should
be worth sending to a people who have not yet learned to read.
Musty libraries of defunct ministers are even more useless in a
freedmen’s school than at the North. Discarded Sunday-school books
are little better; for in any library the readable books are worn
to pieces before the rest are given away. Old files of religious
or other newspapers have their uses; but to make a reading-room
tempting is not one of them.</p>

<p>The matter in a reading-room should be fresh, interesting, and
adapted to the mental condition of those for whom it is provided;
otherwise it cannot be either profitable or inspiring. The
newspapers must contain <em>current</em> news. The magazines must be
adapted to the pupil’s stage of development, which is, so far
as reading is concerned, usually the juvenile stage. Freedmen’s
children are not yet ready, to any considerable extent, for
philosophy or high art.</p>

<p>The books—for there should be books as well as papers in our
reading-rooms—should be fresh, well printed, and, above all,
illustrated. Good pictures, such as are found in the recent
publications of the Harpers and Scribner, illuminate the words
of the book for these young people as nothing else can. And a
book closely printed, on poor paper, without illustration, is a
tax on any reader but the confirmed book-worm. The books should
relate, largely, to the world in its external aspects and to human
achievement—books of travel and adventure, of history in its
romantic phases, the great deeds of great men, whether knights of
war or labor.</p>

<p>To be specific, such books as Knox’s Boy Traveler series, Coffin’s
Histories, Butterworth’s Zizzag Journeys, Swiss Family Robinson,
and even the productions of Jules Verne, placed within the easy and
constant reach of our pupils, would be the most effective means
imaginable for securing the valuable result desired.</p>

<p>Were they well printed and illustrated, I would add to the above
list the old-time “Rollo Books.” Indeed, the list given is but a
fragment of that which might now be made up. Among the periodicals,
<cite>Wide Awake</cite>, <cite>St. Nicholas</cite>, and <cite>Harper’s Young People</cite> should
have a prominent place alongside the <cite>Century</cite> and <cite>Harper’s
Weekly</cite> and <cite>Monthly</cite>.</p>

<p>I have not time to dwell upon the moral results, even more
important than the intellectual ones, sure to come from the
employment of the means herein imperfectly indicated; but I am
sure that reading-rooms such as I have in mind can be made a most
valuable auxiliary of our work in its best and highest purposes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></p>

<p>If any persons chancing to read this, desire fuller information
with a view to co-operation in a good work, I shall be happy to
receive communications from them at any time.</p>

<h3>A GENEROUS WORD FROM THE SOUTH.</h3>

<p class="secauth">FROM THE MEMPHIS APPEAL.</p>

<p>The Memphis <cite>Appeal</cite>, in an editorial column upon the Education
of the Negro, taking as a text the recent Episcopal Congress of
colored men in this city and the Louisville Convention, says to
certain representative men:</p>

<p>“We recommend them to get the annual reports of the American
Missionary Society, of the Southern and Northern Methodist
Churches, and of the African Methodist and Baptist Churches.
From these they will find that more than $20,000,000 have been
expended by these religious organizations since 1864 in building
and maintaining handsome school-houses in which the Negro has been
trained and educated and fitted for the noble task and important
duty of training and educating others. They will find, too, from
these reports that in all these years white men and women of
learning and culture have labored, often in the face of prejudice
and within earshot of contumely and hate. What these missionaries
have done, the world at large has made little note of, but the days
are not far distant when everywhere, through the South at least,
it will be acknowledged as <a name="Err_2" id="Err_2"></a>the greatest of all the great works
accomplished in the United States since 1865. From the Potomac
almost to the Rio Grande the academies and colleges of the American
Missionary Society are to be found at nearly all the large centers
of population, and they are flourishing because their work is a
practical work and their purpose the plain one of widening and
deepening the stream of learning at which the once slaves of the
South may drink freely and at will. These institutions are the
results of a generous benevolence, and have been maintained by
a self-denying zeal worthy of the glorious Luther, whose birth
a grateful world is everywhere celebrating with gladness. We
recommend them to read the reports of the Rev. Atticus G. Haygood,
of Oxford, Ga., who, since he wrote the <cite>Brother in Black</cite>, has
launched into the work of furthering the education of the Negro
with the zeal of a missionary, and the spirit of a soldier in
a noble cause. Dr. Haygood, not long ago, made a tour of the
South in the interest of the fund for which he is the dispensing
agent, and the result is a more fervent devotion to the good work
and more fervid and appealing speeches in its behalf. A gallant
ex-Confederate, a Southerner by birth and breeding, and the son
of a slaveholder, brought up, too, in a wealthy planting section
of Georgia, he entered upon his, at first, self-appointed task as
a mere private, a volunteer in the ranks where he found so many
noble workers. But his knowledge of the Negro, of his capacity, and
his needs, and the best methods of reaching practical educational
results soon marked him for the high position he now occupies
as the trusted and confidential agent of a fund bequeathed by a
benevolent Northern man, whose desire for the advancement and
betterment of the Negro Dr. Haygood is furthering by helping
all the schools at the South that have these for their objects.
Already, in the first year of the existence of the fund, this good,
strong man finds encouraging results following upon what he has
expended of it, and he pleads on every possible occasion with voice
and pen for the extension of the practical system of education so
long pursued by the American Missionary Association, and in which
he sees the best possibilities of the <a class="pagenum" name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a>dark race. Dr. Haygood
speaks plainly, as well as eloquently. He calls a spade a spade.
He does not spare any who set themselves in his way or in the way
of the work he has so much at heart. He knows that education makes
every man better, stronger and happier than he could be without
it and he contends for its dissemination by compulsion if other
means fail of making it general, of bringing it into every man’s
house as essential to the maintenance of the peace that passes all
understanding. It is in the nature of things that such a man should
encounter opposition; that he should even be reviled, abused and
misrepresented, but he has only to take counsel of those who have
occupied the field he is now in during the past twenty years to
find a sweet solace and a consolation for it all. He can read in
their lives the opening chapters of his own career in the field
of Negro education, but he can also read of a generous if tardy
recognition of their labors by the best educated men and women of
the South, who willingly acknowledge their indebtedness to them for
the patient, earnest, laborious work by which in so short a time
nearly forty per cent. of the Negro population has been taught to
read and write, and so many thousands have been trained and fitted
after the most approved technical methods to teach in Negro public
schools and thus perpetuate the blessings they rejoice in the
possession of.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Apostolic Salutation.</span>—At Birmingham, Ala., a city
of only a decade, in its iron and coal interest worthy of its
English namesake, Field Superintendent Roy found Congregational
representatives of half a dozen of our other schools and
churches, who had been drawn to that busy metropolis, as so many
acquaintances of the Apostle Paul in Asia Minor had been drawn
to Rome to be addressed by name in the salutatory chapter of his
Epistle to the Romans before he had himself ever been to that city.
Canon Farrar argues that that chapter must belong to some other
Epistle, on account of the difficulty of the Apostle’s knowing so
many people at Rome. If the Canon of Westminster had only been a
Superintendent of Missions he would have had no such trouble. Dr.
Roy could have given the apostolic salutation to the Saints of this
new church.</p>

<h3>NOTICES ON THE OPENING OF SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p class="secauth">SELECTED FROM CORRESPONDENCE.</p>

<p>Storrs School, Atlanta.—We have enrolled three hundred and seventy
pupils and have been obliged to refuse admittance to fifty on
account of room. We are all wishing for more room and an increase
in our teaching force so that we may receive all that apply. I have
thought for several years that the necessity of the continuance of
Storrs School would cease as the public schools for colored people
increased in number, but I am becoming satisfied that it is a
permanence. The increase in population of this fast growing city,
and the desire of the people for a thorough education keep all the
schools of any value full.</p>

<p>Talladega College.—So far as I can now judge we are to have all
the students we can find room for, and I think more will pay at
least a part of their expenses than heretofore.</p>

<p>Charleston, Avery Institute.—Our opening was admirable in
order, large in numbers, and blessed by the presence of parents
and patrons who gave me a most cordial welcome. There was every
evidence of sincerity about it, and I am<a class="pagenum" name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a> delighted with my
induction and with the two days. The institution is one of the
grandest in design, scope, and progress, and is sufficient to
excite my highest pride.</p>

<p>Tougaloo University.—An unusually large number of independent
applications have been sent in, so that we are likely to have an
overflow of students. These will need to be provided for. You may,
therefore, hear from us again, asking for provisions of shelter to
meet the demand. We never had so many apply before the opening of
school.</p>

<p>Nashville, Tenn.—Fisk University.—We are now able to speak of
our opening as a very favorable one. The number of new students is
larger than usual and of a more advanced class, and the spirit was
never better.</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO FORT SULLY INDIAN MISSION.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. C.&nbsp;O. BROWN.</p>

<p>We had anticipated it with keenest interest, and Providence favored
us. A delightful morning of the first week in August smiled on
our programme, when our party of four persons was ready for the
carriage ride from Pierre to the mission,—Rev. S. Norton, pastor
of the Congregational Church of Pierre; Mr. J. Kimball, of Huron,
Dakota, missionary of the American Sunday-school Union; Timothy
Hudson, Esq.; and the writer, of Kalamazoo, Mich.</p>

<p>The scenery for the first six miles, from the heights which border
the Missouri River, was most charming. At our left, and beneath us,
was the river and its narrow strip of foliage and bottom lands,
having here and there a picturesque dotting of Indian tents; beyond
that, westward turned the grass-covered hills; to our right were
the boundless prairies, beautifully variegated with cultivated
squares of green and golden grain and settlers’ homes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/mission.jpg" width="500" height="247" alt="MISSION HOME, FORT SULLY." />
  <p class="center">MISSION HOME, FORT SULLY.</p>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></p>

<p>An abrupt descent from such an outlook brought us to the valley
beneath, through which the remaining eight miles of our ride
lay. We had only fairly entered the valley when we began to see
evidences of the faithful mission work which has here been done.
For several miles along the river we were constantly passing the
farms of mission Indians, where we saw established homes, quite as
good as those of their white neighbors. We saw full-blooded Indians
in civilized dress, riding their mowing-machines, raking their hay,
and stacking their grain.</p>

<p>Rev. Thomas Riggs was away from home at the bedside of his
venerable father in Beloit, but we were most kindly received by the
lady missionaries in charge, Misses Collins and Irvine. The mission
home into which we were ushered, is a long, tastefully-built
log-house, standing sidewise to the road, having in front two
bay windows, with porch between, and in the rear a large lean-to
attachment for kitchen and laundry. The yard is beautiful with
flowers and plants, and hallowed by a little inner enclosure which
holds the sacred dust of Mrs. Riggs. (Shown in the picture just to
the left of the home.) The large mission garden would be famous in
any neighborhood. It is a sermon in vegetables and small fruits,
well cultivated and highly productive. Just east of the home is
the little chapel, a building capable of seating from 150 to 200
persons, having ceiled walls, and seated with chairs; having a neat
pulpit and a good cabinet organ.</p>

<p>The interior of the home is most inviting. The spacious
sitting-room has little of luxury; everything, however, is most
cheery. The walls are ceiled and adorned with pictures. The bay
window is beautiful with plants and vines and birds. A Steinway
piano is at one end of the room, statuettes here and there, and
books everywhere. During the twenty-four hours of our stay, our
party wandered at liberty over the grounds, visited the chapel,
were received by the Indians in their homes, and in the large room
just described were several times entertained by their singing
while their teachers led on the piano. No honest enemy of Indian
missions could see and hear what we saw and heard, without a change
of heart. Time and again we were melted to tears.</p>

<p>Our visit was entirely unexpected, so nothing could be “gotten up”
for our benefit. We were the better pleased that it should be so.
Everything was impromptu and natural.</p>

<p>The climax came unexpectedly just as we were about to go the next
morning. While two of the brethren were hitching the horses a
party of Indian women and two little boys, who with their baskets
were about to pass the door, were called in by Miss Collins.
They hesitated, and through their teacher apologized for their
appearance, explaining that they had just started on a berrying
trip. One of the men, who had come on some errand, was also invited
in. Then Miss Irvine led on the piano and they all sang from open
hymn books, one after another of the sweet gospel hymns which we
could recognize only by the tunes. As they sang</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Jesus loves me, this I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Bible tells me so,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, happy day that fixed my choice<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On Thee, my Saviour and my God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well may this glowing heart rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And tell its raptures all abroad,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we could not refrain from tears. Our brethren, who had been
attending the horses, heard the music and came in. One glance
unsealed the fountain, and they too wept for joy. Then we all
knelt in prayer. There were prayers in English and prayers in
Dakota language, freely intermingled, and a pervading sense that
the good Father understood it all. When we arose to our feet the
Indians sang<a class="pagenum" name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a> the <cite>Gloria</cite>, and Spotted Bear, by invitation, closed
the meeting with a prayer which touched every heart, although we
could not understand a word of it. The language of the heart is
everywhere the same. And so with hearty hand-shakings and moist
eyes this long-to-be-remembered meeting broke up. We came away
feeling that for many a day we had not enjoyed such a refreshing,
and saying one to another, “Surely God hath made of one blood all
nations of men.”</p>

<h3>REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. W.&nbsp;C. POND.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comparison with Previous Year.</span>—The work of the previous
year (1881 to 1882) was by far the largest we had ever done. The
same superlative applies to the year just closed. Our statistical
table for that year contained the names of fifteen schools, with
a total enrollment for the year of 2,567 pupils. This table shows
nineteen schools with an aggregate enrollment of 2,823. The total
number of months during which schools were sustained was in that
year 153; in this year, 187. Our teachers during that year numbered
31; eleven being Chinese; this year, 41; fourteen being Chinese.
The aggregate number of months of service by our teachers was
then 356; the past year, 423. The aggregate average attendance
was in that year 401; in this, 438. We reported last year 156 as
professing to have ceased from idol worship, and 106 as giving
evidence of conversion; this year we report 175 and 121. But these
numbers represent only those who were in attendance during August,
or during the last month of each school—not by any means the total
number of whom we cherish the hope that they are believers. I am
obliged to send this statement before all the returns upon which
it should be based have come to hand, but I shall be disappointed
if we do not find that more than forty have professed conversion
during the past year, making the total number who have seemed to
us to turn to Christ from the commencement of our work exceed 400.
These are scattered now very widely over the United States and in
China. We hear of many of them as doing good work for the Master
and for the salvation of their countrymen; and those of whom we can
hear nothing, we commit in faith to the Great Shepherd’s tender
care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Finances.</span>—The expense of this work for the past
year has been as follows: For salaries, $8,697.20; for rent of
mission houses, $2,409; for incidental expenses, including fuel,
lights, traveling expenses of Superintendent and helpers, fitting
up and furnishing new mission houses, printing Annual Reports,
etc., etc., $791.85. Total, $11,898.05. The resources have been:
Appropriation by parent society, $7,000; Receipts to treasury and
auxiliary, viz.: From its own auxiliary local missions, $735.05;
from churches, $1,003.60; from donations by individuals and
firms, $2,613, and from Eastern friends, $512. Total, $4,863.
Total resources, $11,863. It should be added that this statement
is necessarily made before the account of the auxiliary (the
California Chinese Mission) is closed, and that we have hope of
some further contributions, sufficient to set the balance on the
right side. The amount raised by the auxiliary last year was
$3,582.30. The increase has been nearly 37 per cent. The most
gratifying elements in this increase are in the offerings of the
churches and of our Chinese brethren. The latter cannot now be
stated exactly, but it is very considerable. The former is from
$532.85 in ’81-’82 to $1,003.60 in ’82-’83; and the number of
churches contributing has doubled rising from 15 to 30.</p>

<h3>CONTRIBUTION FROM A LADY MISSIONARY.</h3>

<p>We do enjoy our work, and it was never more encouraging than now,

lonely workers in these dark corners.</p>

<h3>THE STORY THAT SUBDUED HIM.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY MRS. HARRIET A. CHEEVER.</p>

<p>A man of towering form, straight as an arrow, with copper-colored
skin, stood before a bit of looking-glass in a small wooden
dwelling. The clearing about the little habitation indicated
perseverance and thrift on the part of the owner. It had taken more
than that—hard labor and an almost endless amount of patience had
been required to bring this little portion of a “reservation” into
its present condition.</p>

<p>The tawny man regarding himself in the bit of mirror was
unmistakably a savage, and savage enough his regular features
were as he addressed himself at that moment. He was decently
and comfortably clothed, in garments coarse, but clean and not
ill-fitting. But with an angry, scowling face, and quick, fierce
movements, the young giant was throwing off his garments, growling
in thick, guttural tones, “I kill, I shoot, I burn! Pale face
shan’t push Indian any more; I take th’ warpath again, let pale
face beware—him serpent!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, and he would never have passed for the same man
first seen. His face was daubed with streaks of paint, making it
hideous indeed. The broad wampum belt contained both bowie knife
and pistol, while a coarse jacket and leggings of wolf-skin made
the tall figure appear animal-like in its ungainly trappings.</p>

<p>But what wonder the slumbering savage nature was asserting itself!
For two long years, Trapper Dan—he liked the name the white men
had given him, successful hunter that he was—yes, for two years,
Trapper Dan had worked and slaved, encouraged by really kind
leaders, and with simple faith in the white man’s promises, he
believed the plot of land he was cultivating so untiringly, and the
rude but enduring little building would be his to keep forever. He
was a bright man naturally, and grasped eagerly the offers made by
the superior class of beings known to him as the pale faces.</p>

<p>But now, when things were working never so easily and prosperously,
the reservation was to be broken up, or at least so meanly
encroached upon, that Trapper Dan’s little mite of an estate was
included in the reservation to be reserved no longer.</p>

<p>What wonder, we repeat, that the barbarous instincts of the man
awoke in vengeful fury toward the unscrupulous destroyers of his
peace and his home? For, after all, the holy instincts clustering
about the idea of a home are easily understood and fostered even by
the savage when once he can grasp its blessed meaning.</p>

<p>In hateful guise and with deadly weapons, the hunted trapper
stole, forth under cover of the darkness, his poor heart thirsting
for revenge. He realized vaguely that the Great Spirit would be
displeased at his anger, but he stifled all that as he vaulted
along toward the building where a great meeting was to be held.</p>

<p>A slight young man just entering on a missionary career had
resolved that on this, his first night of addressing the Indians,
he would tell them in the very plainest language possible the
simple story of Jesus and His cross. Doubtless they had heard it
many times before, but no matter, it should be told to-night mainly
in words of one syllable, so that even the most untaught could
understand its import.</p>

<p>Cowering close by one of the openings answering for windows was the
unseen figure of Trapper Dan, his dark<a class="pagenum" name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a> face and darker designs
alike in hiding until the time for action should come. Once the
people were engrossed in the speaker, he would shoot into the
building and bring down more than one pale face on the platform,
then he would hide again, only to pillage and burn later on in the
night.</p>

<p>He did not wish to listen or hear anything that might be said by
a despicable pale face, but when the young missionary, with heart
on fire for very love of his theme, told of the innocent little
baby, born in the far-off East, Dan became unconsciously interested
in <em>that baby</em>. Then, in words, every one of which his hearers
understood, the speaker told of the eager, intelligent boy, who
lingered in the temple to ask questions of the wise old doctors.</p>

<p>Then the child became a man and did wondrous things, and for the
needy, the poor, the blind, the sick, the sinning! In most touching
accents he went on and told of the cruel return this dear child,
this bright boy, this loving, helpful man received at the hands
of those he had only helped and blessed. He came at last to the
piteous scenes at the cross, and when he cried out: “And it was all
for you, poor Indian, for you and me—for us all,” Trapper Dan was
surprised to find the tears raining over his painted cheeks, and
the anger and hatred was all gone from his poor heart. He lingered
to hear the young preacher tell of the forgiveness of the Saviour
towards his cruel enemies, then he turned away; and it was not a
savage any longer, but a softened, forgiving man, who went back to
the crude little home on the borders of the great solemn forest.
He wanted now so much to forgive those who were wronging him, that
early the next morning the land agent was surprised to see Trapper
Dan walk into his office, and holding out a friendly hand, say
bluntly: “I forgive all for the dear Jesus’ sake—he die for poor
Indian. I give up home, give up land—um sorry, but I no harm pale
face.”</p>

<p>Later the same day the missionary found Trapper Dan, and was amazed
at the man’s gentle, forgiving spirit. A ferocious look had stolen
for a moment into his face when telling of his labor and his
wrongs, but it died out at the name of Jesus.</p>

<p>It transpired that the little home was not disturbed after all, and
the missionary not long after remarked feelingly to the agent:</p>

<p>“Only give him a fair chance, only treat him like a man and a
brother, treat him fairly and squarely, teach him Christ so he will
know him for a Saviour, and I will answer for the Indian. He may
appear the savage until taught better things, but he has the heart
of a human being after all.”</p>

A child (without the aid of a teacher,) can learn <b>in a few

if it had gone through months of instruction and hard practice.
<b>It is a grand invention</b> and saves hundreds of dollars to

art; if not, you can go right ahead, <b>and learn all, easily

practice? A few minutes each day at some friend’s residence will
make you perfect, so that you can play anywhere in response
to calls. The highest class of Professors of Music unite in
saying that <b>Buckner’s Music Chart</b> leads anything of its
